# Machine Learning for Price Prediction in AIRBNB

This project was made with Scikit Learn and Python to predict prices with AirBnb database in Rio de Janeiro.

You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data).

For use this model, you need to download the dataset and put it in the same folder of this project.

To start, you need to install the following packages:

requirements.txt

Follow this steps to install the packages:

First, you need to create a virtual environment.

    $ python3 -m venv venv

Now, you can activate the virtual environment:

    $ source venv/bin/activate

Then you can install the packages:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

after that, you can run the code:

    $ python3 airbnb_prices.py

How long time it takes to run the code?
The time is took to run the code is about if you run locally, it depends on the machine, 
if you run on a server, it will be longer, depending your internet speed.

If you want to run the code on a server, you need to install the following packages:
jupyter
jupyterlab
anaconda

Copy all the files in the folder of this project.
Download the notebook in the folder of this project.
Download dataset in the folder of this project.
Run jupyter notebook.

In terminal jus type: jupyter notebook
 
This model has been made for study purposes only.
